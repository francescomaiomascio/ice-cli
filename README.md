ICE CLI is a **command-line interface placeholder** for the ICE ecosystem.

It is intended to provide a developer-facing interface for interacting with ICE
systems once ICE Studio and the underlying runtime components reach maturity.

ICE CLI is currently in a **pre-release, preparatory phase**.

---

## Purpose

ICE CLI exists to:

- Explore command-line interaction patterns for ICE
- Prototype developer workflows and commands
- Prepare the ground for future automation and scripting
- Complement ICE Studio with a terminal-based interface

This repository does **not** yet define a stable CLI tool.

---

## Scope

Planned areas may include:

- System and runtime inspection commands
- Agent and workflow interaction
- Analytics and insights display
- Guided and interactive CLI flows
- Shell completion and developer ergonomics

All functionality is provisional and subject to redesign.

---

## Design Notes

- The CLI is not feature-complete
- Command structure may change
- Flags, commands, and output formats are unstable
- Final scope depends on ICE Studio evolution

This repository prioritizes **experimentation and preparation**.

---

## Usage

ICE CLI is **not intended for production use**.

It will be introduced only after:
- ICE Studio stabilizes
- Core runtime and engine interfaces mature
- CLI workflows are clearly defined

Until then, this repository serves as a placeholder and sandbox.

---

## Status

This project is in a **pre-release, preparatory stage**.
Expect breaking changes and incomplete functionality.
